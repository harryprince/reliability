From Revelle:
Rephrasing Spearman (1904b, 1910) in more current terminology (Lord and Novick, 1968;
McDonald, 1999), reliability is the correlation between two parallel tests where tests are said
to be parallel if for every subject, the true scores on each test are the expected scores across
an infinite number of tests and thus the same, and the true score variances for each test are
the same , and the error variances across subjects for each test are the same.


Reliability, defined as the correlation between two parallel forms of a test, is the
same as the squared correlation of either test with true score and is the amount of true score
variance in the test. Reliability is an increasing function of the correlation between random
split halves of either test...That is, all
six of these equations, although derived in different ways by different people have identical
meanings.

Ï‰ h is an estimate of the general factor saturation of a test based upon a factor analytic
model

From McDonald:

...the precision of measurement of a test score. Generically, this is the problem of reliability. The mathematics of the test reliability theory is extremely
simple. The application of the theory can be problematic.
