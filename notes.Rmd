From Revelle:

Reliability, defined as the correlation between two parallel forms of a test, is the
same as the squared correlation of either test with true score and is the amount of true score
variance in the test. Reliability is an increasing function of the correlation between random
split halves of either test...That is, all
six of these equations, although derived in different ways by different people have identical
meanings.

From McDonald:

...the precision of measurement of a test score. Generically, this is the problem of reliability. The mathematics of the test reliability theory is extremely
simple. The application of the theory can be problematic.
